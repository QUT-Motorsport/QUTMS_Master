Welcome to the QUT Motorsport respoitories. These repositories are focused on the QEV1 car that is currently in-development/testing.

The purpose of this repository is for onboarding new members, serving as a landing point and as a showcase of selected projects, pages and the like.

There is nothing in the wiki yet...

# Systems

The car is split into many different electrical system. Each system has its code and thus its own repository.

Note: These are private repositories. So if you are greeted with anything other than the intended page. Then talk to the exec/electrical team for access. We are only allowing access on a need to code basis, so if you dont currently have access then its highly unlikely you will gain it.
